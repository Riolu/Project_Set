<h1>About the Committee on Analytical Reagents</h1>

<p> The ACS Committee on Analytical Reagents evolved 

from a Committee on the Purity of Chemical Reagents 

that was established in 1903. Analysts then were disturbed 

by the quality of reagents available and the discrepancies 

between labels and the actual purity of the materials. 

The Committee’s role in resolving these issues expanded 

rapidly after its 1921 publication of specifications 

for ammonium hydroxide and for hydrochloric, nitric, 

and sulfuric acids. Specifications appeared initially 

in <i>Industrial and Engineering Chemistry</i> and later 

in its <i>Analytical Edition</i>. In 1941, the existing 

specifications were reprinted in a single pamphlet. 

Revisions and new specifications were later gathered 

into a book, the 1950 edition of <i>Reagent Chemicals</i>. 

Two editions per decade followed except during the 1970s, 

when only one edition was published. </p>

<p>The commonplace introduction of instrumentation into 

analytical laboratories, beginning in the late 1950s, 

resulted in dramatic improvements in the sensitivity 

and accuracy of analytical measurements. In line with 

these improved instruments, the requirements for reagent 

chemicals and the tests used to measure their purity 

needed to be improved. Under the capable leadership 

of Stanley Clabaugh and later Vernon A. Stenger, Samuel 

M. Tuthill, and Wallace Rohrbough, these improvements 

were made during the 1960s and 1970s. The first instrumental 

technique, flame emission spectroscopy, was introduced 

into the book in 1961. It was followed by other appropriate 

techniques in an effort to develop test methods that 

would be as accurate and cost-effective as possible. 

</p>

<p>The <b>Eighth Edition</b>, which became official 

in 1993, substantially changed and updated the general 

procedures and attempted to make the book easier to 

read. Format changes included a new requirement layout 

and a continuation of the trend toward detailed general 

methods in the front of the book, with only reagent-specific 

test conditions under each individual chemical. Updated 

methods included gas chromatography (in which capillary 

columns were first used) water determination (in which 

coulometric methods were added) and the replacement 

of flame emission techniques by atomic absorption for 

metal determinations. Sections on determining method 

detection limits and the preparation and standardization 

of volumetric solutions were also added. In addition, 

the Eighth Edition saw the elimination of boiling point 

and density requirements and the replacement of the 

test for substances not precipitated by ammonium sulfide 

by specific metals determination using atomic absorption.</p>

<p> The <b>Ninth Edition</b> continued the trend of 

eliminating or simplifying some of the tedious classical 

procedures for trace analysis, and adding instrumental 

methods where possible. Classical procedures such as 

gravimetry and titrimetry, however, continued to be 

the corner stone of the assay procedures for inorganic 

reagents because of their inherent higher precision 

and accuracy for the determination of major components. 

New analytical techniques introduced included mass, 

infrared and, plasma emission spectroscopy, and ion 

and thin layer chromatography. For the first time reagents 

suitable for use in ultra trace analysis, such as sub-boiled 

acids packaged in Teflon containers, were specified. 

This required that &quot;clean room&quot; analytical 

practices be covered, and accounts for the inclusion 

of more sophisticated analytical techniques such as 

plasma emission spectroscopy. The most significant change 

in this edition was the addition of standard grade reference 

materials. This was done at the request of the Chemical 

Reference Materials Manufacturers Association (CRMMA) 

with the support and encouragement of the National Institute 

of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency (EPA). Approximately four hundred 

standards were specified in a separate section following 

the traditional reagent chemicals.</p>

<p> Early in the planning stages for the <b>Tenth Edition</b> 

of <i>Reagent Chemicals</i>, Committee members voiced 

a desire for one book that met all of their needs for 

information on analytical reagents. They acknowledged 

that <i>Reagent Chemicals</i> is used in conjunction 

with other texts for information on the physical properties 

and the uses of analytical reagents. This resulted in 

a new direction for <i>Reagent Chemicals</i>, the inclusion 

of general physical properties and analytical uses for 

each reagent. </p>

<p>The Tenth Edition continues the initiative to simplify 

the classical chemical methods and substitute instrumental 

analysis where appropriate. This edition introduces 

a new instrumental method, inductively coupled plasma 

mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) for trace metal analysis. 

It also revises and updates procedures for polarography. 

Tests have been modified to take into account current 

laboratory practices and technology, as well as to eliminate 

the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. </p>

<p>Since the Ninth Edition, the Committee on Analytical 

Reagents has required validation<br>

protocols as part of the approval process for adding 

new reagents. In the Tenth Edition,<br>

32 new reagents and three new classes of standard-grade 

reference materials are introduced, all of which have 

validation protocols. </p>

<p>Other improvements in the Tenth Edition are intended 

to make the book easier to use. Some of these improvements 

include a CAS number index, a separate index for the 

standard-grade reference materials, complete assay calculations 

with titer values, an updated table of atomic weights, 

frequently used mathematical equations, a quick reference 

page on how to read a monograph, division of the book 

into parts, and a detailed table of contents for each 

part.</p>

<p>Finally, a subtitle has been added to the Tenth Edition. 

This represents a slight shift in thinking and internal 

nomenclature. Traditionally, the Committee has referred 

to the individual entry for each reagent chemical as 

a specification, and each specification had two components: 

the requirements and the tests. However, these terms 

led to some confusion and, beginning with the Tenth 

Edition, the Committee has adopted the term <i>monograph</i> 

for the complete package of information for each reagent 

chemical—the general description, specifications, requirements, 

and tests. The <i>specification</i> refers to the purity 

requirements of the reagent, and the <i>requirement</i> 

is the level of purity required for the reagent to be 

considered “ACS Reagent Grade”.</p>
