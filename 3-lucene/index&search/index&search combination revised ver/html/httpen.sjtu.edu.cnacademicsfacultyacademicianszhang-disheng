<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Professor ZHANG Disheng was born in June, 1916. He has been working in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery field for more than half a century. He had been involved in the job of saving and curing the wounded anti-Japanese soldiers at the Chinese Guiyang red cross headquarter and the frontier of Indian and Burma in the war time. The two difficult problems of sequelae, dysfunction and deformation left by war on the wounded disturbed him so much that he set up his mind to study plastic and reconstructive surgery. He received his primary education in the field from Professor Zhang Xianlin while participating in the battle-field aiding, which in turn equipped him with a solid foundation of the trauma surgery and the practical experience of the plastic surgery. In 1950, he led his operation team to join in the first operation treatment team of Shanghai city to go and help North Korea, and set up the first clinic center in Changchun to treat the deformation from the war. In 1958, he took part in the rescue of Qiu Caikang who suffered a serious burn with a large burnt area and succeeded in making a miracle in the world, and won a 2nd class prize by the Department of Public Health of the central government. In the mid 1960s, professor ZHANG worked with perseverance on the causes and treatment of the body chronic lymph oedema, created a new concept of &ldquo;Heating and Bandage Treatment&rdquo;, and made a beginning in the lymph subject of China. Professor Zhang had begun animal experiments of connecting the tiny blood vessel while disassociating the flap as early as in 1964, and in the early 1970s the technique was applied to the plastic and reconstructive surgery practice. He is one of the founders of the domestic micro-surgery. He combined the micro-surgery and the plastic and reconstructive surgery together, challenged the traditional concept of &ldquo;reconstructive surgery&rdquo;, proposed a new concept of integrating the figure reconstruction and function restoration, and promoted the development of the plastic and reconstructive surgery greatly. In China, the cranium-facial plastic and reconstructive surgery is a field that had never been visited before, and due to its high degree of difficulty and risk, only several countries such as France, USA, Australia, etc. had been attempted the operation. However, in 1976, professor Zhang successfully carried out the first surgical treatment of hyperterolism in China, thus pushed our cranium-facial surgery to the leading position in the world. He thus attained the 1st class award of the Scientific and Technological Achievement given by Shanghai city, the 2nd class award given by the Ministry of Public Health, and the 3rd class award of the Scientific and Technological Achievement given by the State in 1994.</p>
<h3>Research Fields</h3>
<p>In April, 1996, Professor Zhang Disheng successfully carried out the first case of surgical treatment of congenital defect of the sternum in China. Presently, headed by professor Zhang, Shanghai Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Institute has developed into a world renowned center that engages four big branches, i.e. later period burn, micro surgery and limb wound, Cranio-facial surgery and esthetic surgery and 170 beds and is prestigious for its many famous experts, outstanding technologies, distinct characteristics and advanced facilities. The institute was evaluated as a keystone development subject of Shanghai in 1982. In 1995 it was evaluated as the leading specialized subject of Shanghai. In 1997, the Tissue Engineering Institute laboratory was established and has become one of the key laboratories of Shanghai city. Zhang Disheng himself had been awarded the Advanced Worker of Shanghai city, the Outstanding Worker in the Educational Circles of Shanghai, the Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker of Shanghai, Model Worker of Shanghai, and the Outstanding Personnel of State Education Commission.</p>
<p>Professor Zhang Disheng's outstanding achievements in the plastic and reconstructive surgery field has stimulated strong echoes internationally. Professor Zhang Disheng has been abroad to visit and lecture on behalf of China frequently and has been hired as guest professor by many foreign universities. He has membership in nearly 10 international academic associations, such as International Micro-surgery Committee, Consultant Panel of the Board, etc. He was chairman of the Seventh International Micro-surgery Academic conference. Just as the Chairman of the International Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery said: &ldquo;The medical treatment in Shanghai Plastic and Reconstructive Institute is no inferior to any similar surgery centers in the world.&rdquo; Professor Zhang is also praised as &ldquo;Honor to Asia &rdquo; by some famous experts in the medical field in countries like Japan and Singapore.</p>
<h3>Main Publications</h3>
<p>Professor Zhang Disheng has many awarded research results. His &ldquo;Free transfer of jejunum for the repair of esophagus defects by micro-surgical technique&rdquo;, &ldquo;Transfer the skin of foot toe and back to repair thumb&rdquo;, &ldquo;Free transfer of omentum for treatment of injury of the scalp&rdquo; was awarded the first and second class prizes of Scientific and Technological Achievement in the Medical Healthy Field given by the Ministry of Public Health in 1989; &ldquo;One-stage reconstruction of penis by micro-vascular techniques&rdquo; was awarded the 3rd class prize of the Important Scientific and Technological Achievement given by Shanghai Municipal Government; &ldquo;Transplant toe joints to treat temple-cheek ankylosis&rdquo; was awarded the second class prize of Scientific and Technological Achievement in the Medical Healthy Field given by the Ministry of Public Health. Professor Zhang is now in his 80s, and his contribution to the plastic and reconstructive surgery field in China has been recorded in history, yet he is still working without feeling tired.</p>
