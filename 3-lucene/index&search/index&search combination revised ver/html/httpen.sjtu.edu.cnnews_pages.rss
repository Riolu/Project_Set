ISTIC put more emphasis on quality rather than quantity of SCI paper since 2010. SJTU won gratifying achievements in some important aspects in relation to the quality of papers: ranked the nation's second place in total cites of papers published internationally, as well as in Outstanding papers (total cites beyond average) and co-authored papers; ranked the nation's third place in quantity of papers published in journals with high impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, SJTU ranked second for the sixth consecutive year in number of papers collected by SCI: 5398 with a year-on-year growth of 497; ranked the nation's second place in SCI cites in past decade: 35488 with a year-on-year increase of 13794; held its nation's second place in quantity of SCI outstanding papers: 2402 with a year-on-year growth of 480; ranked the nation's second place in co-authored papers as first author: 1220 with a year-on-year increase of 162; held the nation's third place in quantity of papers published in journals with high impact factors in 154 disciplines with 181 papers; ranked the nation's fourth place in number of papers collected by SCI journal with top 10% impact factors: 762 with a year-on-year increase of 76; ranked the nation's fourth place in papers collected by &lt;em&gt;Science, Nature, Cell and PNAS&lt;/em&gt; with total number 8. Paper entitled "Security and privacy for storage and computation in cloud computing" and "Activating hotspot L205R mutation in PRKACA and adrenal Cushing's syndrome", written by Associate Professor Zhu Jinhao from School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering and Ning Guang' research group from Rui Jin Hospital under School of Medicine respectively, were collected in "China's 100 Most Influential Academic Papers Publish Internationally in 2014".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above data show that, with the vision on top-notch university, internal strength and academic atmosphere along with international cooperative school-running, SJTU witnessed its steady growth in both quality and quantity of scientific and technical papers, in a result further enhanced the university's international academic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

Via probing into the model system of hard-sphere glass (the granular packing system), they brought it to light that glass transition was probably a type of special structure phase transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=" Glass Transition" src="/assets/4744/1_normal.jpg" alt=" Glass Transition" width="600" height="366" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of rapid cooling, liquid will not turn into subcooled liquid via crystallization, instead, with the rapid increase of the coefficient of viscosity by a dozen orders of magnitude, the glass transition occurs, and liquid becomes glass state. The issue of glass transition is one of the most important issues in the field of Condensed Matter Physics. As &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson"&gt;P.W. Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, Noble Prize winner and Professor of &lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, put it in 1995, "The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and glass transition". Furthermore, the issue was listed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(magazine)"&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt; as one of the 125 major unsolved problems in science in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=" Glass Transition" src="/assets/4745/2_normal.jpg" alt=" Glass Transition" width="640" height="420" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, there exist so many theories on the issue of glass transition that no unanimous solution has been found. The research result of Wang Yujie's team indicates that glass transition may be a common structural phase transition analogous to the course of crystallization, which provides key experimental evidence for finally tackling the problem of glass transition which has remained unsolved for around fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6 days heated competition, 2015 World Finals of &lt;a href="http://www.igem.org/Main_Page"&gt;iGEM(International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition)&lt;/a&gt; came to its end recently in Hynes Convention Center. Two teams from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, named SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and SJTU-Software won the gold medal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4740/IGEM_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="480" height="358" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Academician &lt;a href="http://life.sjtu.edu.cn/english/index.php/component/comprofiler/userprofile/Lin%20He?Itemid=222"&gt;He Lin&lt;/a&gt; and Associate Professor Ma Gang, SJTU-Biox-Shanghai consisted of 14 undergraduates from SJTU &lt;a href="http://life.sjtu.edu.cn/english/"&gt;School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/"&gt;Zhiyuan College&lt;/a&gt;. The team's project "Cyano Pac-man" was to build biodesalination system in cyanobacteria. Common seawater desalination technology, such as reverse osmosis could not be scaled up to wide use due to high energy consumption. To develop biodesalination was to build an effi&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cient and energy-saving desalination system. The team used photosynthetic cyanophyta as desalination chassis cell and light-driven CI pump halorhodopsin as desalination driver, dark-induced promoter as desalination controller, successfully built an energy-efficient biodesalination system depending only on natural light and dark conditions. This biodesalination system successfully lowered the concentration of Na and CI by 20% in lab environment. The team kept practicing and exploring feasible cyanophyta-water separation process. The team put forward with the idea that biodesalination can be used as pretreatment of reverse osmosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervised by Chaochun Wei, Hongyu Ou and Feng Chen, SJTU-Software was a team of 14 undergraduates from School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, School of Biochemical Engineering and School of Media and Design. The team's project "BASE" was developed from last year's project "Easy BBK-An Easy Biobrick Blueprint's Package". "BASE" integrated main functions of "Easy BBK" and implemented it by web application. The team built a new BioBrick database and added more information about BioBrick to official database. This was to better measure reliability level in experiment and sort search results by user need or BioBrick mass. The BioBrick drawing tool designed by the team made it possible for standardization of future BioBrick and the design of smart guided BioBrick. Moreover, the uploading tool developed by the team could connect information of each sub BioBrick with database, thus making uploading information more efficient. The innovative design aroused interest of judges and received excellent review in poster presentation and oral defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;iGEM was first launched by MIT in 2004, designed for college students and gradually developed to be the top academic competition in Synthetic Biology. Supervised by specialized committee, the competition was also an interdisciplinary contest that involved mathematics, physics, electronics and computer science. iGEM requires contestants to select topic independently and trains their independent innovation, teamwork spirit and enthusiasm in science. The competition is also an international exchange platform for students majoring in diversified fields from the world over. iGEM 2015 attracted 270 teams from the globe, including teams from top universities such as MIT, Harvard, Cambridge and Heidelburg University. China sent 61 teams to the competition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Each year several projects in iGEM were published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;. In addition, iGEM expects excellent comprehensive capabilities and skills from contestants, it also covers various non-experiment tasks, for example, designing poster for project introduction, launching awareness campaigns to popularize Synthetic Biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 15, 2015 marks the release of the newest edition of the &lt;a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings"&gt;QS World University Rankings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt; was listed Top 70 in QS World University Rankings with 7 subjects ranking World Top 50 and 18 subjects ranking World Top 100. In order to better reflect the characteristics of various subjects, the QS ranking indicators this year were balanced for weight adjustment. After extensive consultation with expert opinion, QS did standardization process to the indicator "Citations per faculty" and each five fields of subjects takes up 20 percent in comprehensive performance. The improvement of Shanghai Jiaotong University further reflects the coordination of different subjects with "comprehensive, research-based and international" school policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of the QS World University Rankings is to help students make informed comparisons of leading universities around the world. Based on six performance indicators, the rankings are designed to assess universities in four areas: research, teaching, employability and internationalization. Each of the six performance indicators carries a different weighting when calculating the overall scores with academic reputation (40%), employer reputation (10%), student-to-faculty ratio (20%), citations per faculty (20%), international faculty ratio (5%) and international student ratio (5%). For the 2015/16 edition, the rankings for Academic reputation draw on just under 76,800 responses from academics worldwide. The employer reputation indicator is also based on a global survey, taking in more than 44,200 responses for the 2015/16 edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SJTU had improved gradually in QS World University Rankings and this year marks the first time that SJTU was listed as World Top 100, moving up by 34 positions to the 70th. In the 2015 QS World University rankings, SJTU ranked third in the country with seven subjects of Shanghai Jiaotong University ranking among the world's top 50 and 18 subjects ranking the world's top 100 with 25 subjects entering the 200. The top 50 subjects are art and design, civil and structural engineering, machinery, aerospace and manufacturing engineering, materials science, electrical and electronic engineering, construction, and statistics. The series of all kinds of progress in QS World University Rankings of Shanghai Jiaotong University fully reflects improvement of academic ability and academic reputation in recent years which consolidate the foundation for SJTU's completion of a comprehensive world-class university in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Professor&lt;a href="http://zhanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Show.aspx?info_lb=309&amp;amp;info_id=307&amp;amp;flag=297"&gt; Zhang Dabing&lt;/a&gt; of SJTU was included in &lt;a href="http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/my.aspb.org/resource/resmgr/docs/aspbtopauthors.pdf"&gt;a name list&lt;/a&gt; announced by&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Plant_Biologists"&gt;American Society of Plant Biologists (APSB)&lt;/a&gt;, which recognized the authors of the most highly cited papers published between 2009 and 2013. Altogether nine Asian scientists were acknowledged in the list and Professor Zhang was the only scientist from mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APSB was founded in 1924 and has been committed to boosting the advancement and development of plant biology, fostering research as well as publishing the latest results in the area, enhancing plant biologists' research interests and helping them score achievements in their research areas. The APSB publishes two journals, including &lt;a href="http://www.plantcell.org/site/misc/about.xhtml"&gt;Plant Cell&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 1989 and having an average impact factor of 10.529 in the past five years) and &lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" name="OLE_LINK2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" name="OLE_LINK1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/"&gt;Plant Physiology&lt;/a&gt; (found in 1926 and having an average impact factor of 8.03 in the past five years), which are both respected as the authoritative journals on botany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APSB first introduced the authors of the most highly cited papers in 2009, mainly covering scientists from North America and Europe. This year, APSB analyzed the global citations to Plant Cell and Plant Physiology for papers published between 2009 and 2013, and listed the authors from Asia, Australia, North America, Middle East and Africa. Professor Zhang has conducted systematic research into reproduction and development with respect to rice and other plants, revealing multiple molecular mechanisms that control the formation of rice inflorescence, rice flower organs, and rice pollen. Between 2009 and 2013, Professor Zhang published 8 papers in Plant Cell and 9 in Plant Physiology, which are all highly cited. As a result, he was include in the list as the only scientist from mainland China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;August 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; was the last day of the World Championship. In the high jump men final, Zhang Guowei, undergraduate student in grade 2013, majoring in Human Resources Management in &lt;a href="http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/"&gt;Antai College of Economics and Management&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt;&#65288;SJTU&#65289;&#65292;shared the silver medal with Ukrainian Bondarnko with 2.33 meters height during the overtime so that he surpassed Zhu Jianhua's bronze medal record in 1983 Helsinki World Championship and made the best record for Chinese Track and Filed Team in World Championship in the field of high jump, which was also the same as the best record for Asian athlete in this field in the World Championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;In the preliminary contest, Zhang Guowei made the 2.31 meters easily and entered the final. The starting height of the final is 2.20 meters. Zhang Guowei made it 2.20, 2.25, 2.29 and 2.33. At then, there were only 5 athletes left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Because of the weather, no one made it when it reached 2.36 meters. Three athletes including Zhang Guowei had the same grade. According to the rules of the championship, they three entered the overtime contest. For no one could successfully surpass the 2.36 meters. They made it 2.34 in the overtime. Drouin was the first to make it, but Bondarnko and Zhang Guowei both failed. Thus they two shared the second position and Zhang Guowei created the new history for Chinese high jump business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang Guowei had good marks in this season. He made it 2.38, 2.36, 2.35 etc. Currently, he was only second to Qataris Barshim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015, the China Institute of Legal History 2015 Annual Academic Conference &amp;amp; the International Symposium on "Traditional Legal Culture and Modern Rule of Law Culture" was held in Shenyang. Professor Leo KoGuan, Honorary Trustee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Honorary Professor of KoGuan Law School, and Director of KoGuan International Rule of Law and Principle Studies Center&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was invited to participate in the conference and give the keynote speech on "Xuan Yuan Calling: A Draft for Chinese Consensus 4712XY". The conference was hosted by China Institute of Legal History, organized by Shenyang Normal University School of Law and co-organized by KoGuan Chinese Rule of Law and Principle Studies Center, Tsinghua University School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4692/image002_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="552" height="224" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Leo passionately made a wonderful speech for all participants. He incorporated equations and numbers into the 00 poem (KQID engine) that precisely computed the creation and distribution of our Universe and Existence and composed Xuan Yuan Calling poem (Xuan Yuan Anti-entropic Operating System 2.0).The two poems expressed his theory in a nutshell in one bookmark. He was the first person rejuvenated Xuan Yuan 2.0 powered by the Chinese Engine with scientific equations that produce detailed numbers to explain and predict things that cannot be explained and predicted by the existing Newtonian engine, Einstein Relativity, the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) and the Standard Model Cosmology. The KQID engine computes in a specific and detailed way with equations and numbers which is verifiable and falsifiable. He succinctly iterated that the Xuan Yuan 2.0 is the rule of Dao, which is the best of all possible rules that unifies Humanity with Science based on Seeking Truth from Facts and the unity of names and forms.&lt;/p&gt;

He Zhonglin, Deputy Director of the Research Office of the Supreme Court, highlighted his speech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese culture derives from Xuan Yuan Dao, which is the ontology of the "Chineseness" of being Chinese. It does not depend on people's DNA, but their cultural identity. In China, everything is based on Rule of Dao, Rule of the Party, Rule of the People, Rule of Law and Rule of Virtues. Xuan Yuan's jurisprudence relies openly upon rule of Dao that sets the boundary and the guiding principle for Chinese rule of law. (&lt;a href="http://www.rmfz.org.cn/tbch/2015-08-20/11118_2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;People&amp;middot;Rule of Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his keynote speech, Prof. Leo and President Wu Yuzhang presided over the seminar to elaborate on the ontology of the "Chineseness" of being Chinese. After full and heated discussion, the participating scholars fully recognized Prof. Leo's scholarly works and achieved preliminary consensus that from rule of Dao come rule of law and rule of virtues as the authentic Chinese jurisprudence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordinary audiences are quite familiar with science fiction movies, like The Matrix, Interstellar and so on. But it is not easy to name a decent Chinese science fiction movie. So people are wondering: why China cannot make a science fiction blockbuster? Where are China's science fiction movies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4691/jiangxiaoyuan_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="354" height="461" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;em&gt;Jiang Xiaoyuan Science Fiction Movie Guide&lt;/em&gt; written by Pro. Jiang Xiaoyuan, expert in history of science, is released by&lt;a href="http://en.jiaodapress.com.cn/"&gt; Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press&lt;/a&gt; and holds a news conference in 2015 Shanghai Bookfair. This guide book is considered as the first in-depth interpretation for science fiction of a scholar in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that Jiang Xiaoyuan initiated his study in science fiction movies in 2003 when SARS was plaguing China. After a dozen years, this recreational mode is changed into academic research. He has published lots of film review on science fiction movies. This book is a by-product of above mentioned academic researches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into ten chapters, involving more than 180 science fictions. There are classic movies, like The Matrix, movies of small audiences, like Double Vision. The shooting of Chinese science fiction movie, Three Body, is sure to bring more and more discussion regarding this field. As to the "First Year of Chinese Science Fiction", Mr. Jiang believes that it could open starts with a successful native Chinese blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Cixin, science fiction writer, attended the conference and said that this book established a brand new comment context and perspective, from which it pointed to the core heart of the science fiction movie. "There is no lack of money or technology for Chinese science fiction. What we are lack of is our imagination and feelings. In other words, We are lack of recognition for science fiction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's Notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zhang Disheng, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Academician&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Chinese&amp;nbsp;Academy&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, died &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;on August 19 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;in Shanghai. He was 100 years old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zhang Disheng was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, member of fifth, sixth, seventh Shanghai Committee of Chinese People Consultative Conference National Committee, the founder of plastic surgery and reconstructive surgery, excellent physician, educator, scientist, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Shanghai role model, professor of &lt;a href="http://english.shsmu.edu.cn/"&gt;Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and former president of Affiliated Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following article was especially written for SJTU column "Scholars' essay" by Zhang Disheng in 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4689/Zhangdisheng_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="457" height="640" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking a Correct Attitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in history, the occupation of doctor is adored by Chinese for various reasons. Some would like to be a good person so they become doctors and some just practice medicine for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that young people first ask yourself a few "Why", before choosing medicine. If you only want to feed your families, you need not study medicine. Especially in the current domestic medical environment, becoming a doctor requires more inputs and limited outputs. If you make a change in career and spend the same energy in other field, it would be absolutely not difficult to earn bigger achievements. A few years ago, I heard that there are young doctors leaving the medical industry because of low income and high pressure. I can fully understand their practices, but I can not help but regret for them. Life can not afford to toss. Instead of drop halfway after the switch, I recommend you to think clearly before choosing where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pursuit of Excellence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The pursuit of excellence does not mean that we should disregard the actual situation and establish unattainable goals. As Lincoln put it, "I would use the best of my knowledge, the best I can to do the best, and I have been determined to do so." As a plastic surgeon, I comprehend it too well. Many cosmetic surgery, seem so simple and a lot of doctors will say they can do, but the effect may be different. Generally an excellent plastic surgeon has a "perfectionist" mentality, and always pays more attention to details than others. Adhering to this habit, you will continue to find more ways and techniques and make the ordinary things better. That is a remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being Bold but Cautious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I am disturbed that, in recent years, due to the deterioration of the health care environment, when faced with difficult cases, many doctors become fearful. Many doctors worry that the doctor-patient relationship are tired. I'm looking forward to the establishment of strict safeguards against both doctors and patients. Perhaps by that time, the patient will be calmer, the doctor will regain courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Plastic surgery I am engaged in is an interdisciplinary subject established on the basis of discipline and my personal achievements and are mainly concerned with interdisciplinary. For example, if I do not communicate with colleagues in other disciplines, I will miss the "Microsurgery" trend; If I do not pay attention to Chinese medicine, I can not think of the treatment of chronic lymphedema of "bake tied therapy" and homemade cream treatment of burn scar patients. It should be noted that, all these achievements are made in my sixties, seventies, which of course has something to do with a special historical context, but also my knowledge, experience accumulated to a certain extent, has finally paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contemplation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Finally, I would like to give message to the younger generation. If in the future you have the opportunity to climb the peak on medicine, while enjoying the scenery at the same time at the top, please be sure to find time to bow to look at the bottom and seriously think about their living conditions and expectations. Because they have passion, but it is more helpless. This may be unrelated to responsibility, but in respect of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than   one century, SJTUers have got innumerable great achievements with their   knowledge and wisdom, including many firsts in modern and contemporary   Chinese history. This reflects wisdom of talent training, scientific   research, serving the society and glory for the country. In memory of SJTUer's   great contribution to China's prosperity, SJTU News sets up a new column   named "SJTU Wisdom" to tell their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 3, 2015, the international academic journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt; published a   theoretical paper (&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat4384"&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat4384&lt;/a&gt;) on new stanene   written by Prof. Qian Dong and Jia Jinfeng's research group together with   their academic partners. Both of Prof. Qian and Jia are from Department of   Physics and Astronomy in SJTU. After a long-time in-depth experiment and   exploration, their team found a suitable substrate material and growth   conditions, and first prepared stanene, the two-dimensional crystal thin-film   material with MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same day, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; reported this research finding with the headline "Physicists announce   graphene's latest cousin: stanene" and highlighted the amazing physical   properties of this new material. Scholars from home and aboard affirmed this   big breakthrough in two-dimensional crystal material and commented that this   is the first and a key step to realize its amazing properties and functions   in the future (doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18113). Chemistryworld, official   website of RSC (the Royal Society of Chemistry) reported this finding in   details with the headline "New two-diensional tin material created" on August   5. &lt;em&gt;Science alert&lt;/em&gt; also did a report   on it with the title "Physicists produce world's first sample of potential   wonder-material: stanene".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As graphene achieves great success, IV group elements two-dimensional   crystal material comes into focus of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials   Science. Although stanene is a theoretically ideal and novel quantum   material, it is still a long way to go for researchers in Condensed Matter   Physics and Materials Science to produce stanene material in experiment, in   the condition of difficulties in material preparation and physics knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic Band Structure of Stanene Thin-Film &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Jia Jinfeng and his team from Department of Physics and Astronomy   of SJTU has long committed to preparation and research of new quantum   material. They are the first to prepare Topological Insulator (or   superconductor heterojunction), thus accumulated deep experience in thin-film   epitaxial growth. After incessant exploration and practice, they finally   found that with a precise growing condition, the growth pattern of Sn atom changed   and formed a thin layer. In this way, the dream stanene is successfully   prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research group overcame two difficulties to prove that this   thin-film was&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stanene. They found that the atomic   structure and electronic band structure delivered from the experiment were in   good consistency with the result of first-principle calculation, consequently   confirmed that the epitaxial growth was two-dimensional stanene thin-film. This   theoretical paper attracted tremendous attention in the international academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research project was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology   and NSFC (Nature Science Foundation of China). It took two years for Prof.   Jia Jinfeng's research group from SJTU and Prof. Zhang Shousheng's   theoretical group from Tsinghua University and Stanford University to   complete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glycosphingolipid is an amphipathic glycolipids compound made up by ceramide and oligosaccharide chain through glucosidic bonds and widely participates in the biochemical signaling between cells and surroundings. It plays an important role in each stage of cells, such as proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. Glycosphingolipids compound has certain efficacy against some serious disease, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and autoimmune disease etc.. However, as the chemosynthetic methods of lyso-glycosphingolipid is constrained by its complicated process and low productivity, the development of this field was affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous works, the research group found that N-deacylase&lt;em&gt; for &lt;/em&gt;glycosphingolipid&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;of Shewanella alga&lt;/em&gt;G8 which is from the marine bacteria can high-effective catalyze the biphasic response of degradation and synthesis of glycosphingolipid chains, which has an important application potential in the synthesis of lyso-glycosphingolipid &#65288;&lt;em&gt;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol&lt;/em&gt;, 2015, 99(16), 6715-6726 ). As this enzyme coexist the activity of hydrolysis and synthesis and they will compete against each other in catalyzed reaction, which results in the reaction yield only ranges from 40% to 60%. In this research, the enzymatic reaction system of SCDase was optimized. By introducing high concentrations of alk Li-earth metal ion and proper surfactant, the balance of enzyme reaction was successfully controlled. Under the best condition, the conversion rate of SCDase can increase to over 96%. This method is easy to handle and magnify, the productivity of GM1 in 12 hours can increase to 90%, which is significantly above the best results reported in current literatures (72% productivity in two weeks) and shows a promising application in large-scale production and structure innovation of glycosphingolipid drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At present, this technology has applied for China's invention patent. The research group is using efficient synthetic activity and wide substrates selectivity of SCDase to promote many different types of fatty-acid chains and lyso-glycosphingolipid compound non-natural glycosphingolipid molecular library, so as to lay the foundation for the development of more glycosphingolipid drugs with higher efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of a genetically conditioned food-craving behavior, bodyweight management of children with PWS has previously proven to be extraordinarily difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hospitalized 12-week dietary intervention trial, children with PWS lost nearly 20% of their bodyweight without the need for rigorous exercises. They achieved better behavioral control of food cravings, which made it easier for parents to help them continue the diet at home. A 14 year-old PWS volunteer experienced a significant weight loss from 140 kg to 73 kg after 430 days of adherence to the diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interventional diet was based on whole-grains, traditional Chinese medicinal foods and prebiotics. It contained balanced macro- and micro-nutrients to meet the children's nutritional needs. It also provided large amounts of complex carbohydrates that are non-digestible by humans but that feed beneficial bacteria in the gut, allowing them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed that the pre-intervention gut microbiota induced more fat accumulation than the post-intervention one from the same PWS volunteer when both were transplanted into germfree mice. The team found that the interventional diet significantly improved the gut microbiota and reduced the amount of obesity-related toxins in blood and urine produced by gut bacteria. Particularly, this diet promoted the growth of a beneficial species called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum&lt;/em&gt;, which may work as a "foundation species" to promote other beneficial bacteria and reduce toxin-producing ones. Such foundation species are just like tall trees for a rainforest, which can cover the ecosystem and create a unique environment to support the thriving of all other members of a healthy gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the evidences provided in the paper strengthen the notion that the diet-induced changes of the gut microbiota may have contributed to health improvement of the human hosts. This study opens the possibility of developing an effective nutritional therapy for childhood genetic obesity with the gut microbiota as a primary target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper was published in EBioMedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the beginning of the party, Jiang Sixian gave a speech to all the graduates. He shared his own stories in&lt;a href="/"&gt; SJTU&lt;/a&gt;, and expressed his keen expectation for the graduates. At last, Jiang Sixian asked students to go back to the campus at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening party, all the graduates finished their last lesson in SJTU. During the party, fantastic performance and videos interwove, which led the graduates to recollect all the details of their campus life. Four years' time is such a short period, that all those young faces four years ago were like they just appeared yesterday. The dancing performance from the Association of International Standard Dancing was very enthusiastic, and taekwondo performance reminded students of their military training in the hot summer of 2012. All those songs and dance pushed the party to a climax. In the video "Ordinary People", all the graduates memorized their way through this four years, and were touched to tears. At last, in the melody of the song "Goodbye", all of the audience stood up, and the party for the 3700 graduates approached to its end. Everyone was reluctant to leave, and embraced people around, hoping that the time would last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back to the past four years, the most touching memory about youth was in them. The graduation party may be a final chapter of the F11ers, but it was also the opening of a new story. Hope all graduates could write more splendid stories in their future.&lt;/p&gt;

The high incidence drives the improvements of AMI emergency care, which help prolong patients' life. Therefore, rehabilitation and working ability assessment of AMI patients are gaining importance. However, there is no concise grading and assessment system for cardiac damage level after AMI in clinical practice. Recently, Prof. He Ben, Cardiology expert at Renji Hospital of SJTU &lt;a href="http://english.shsmu.edu.cn/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, first proposed a new criteria for grading cardiac trauma after AMI, which attracted widespread attention in academic circles from home and abroad. The research findings of Prof. He Ben's team are published online in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; (PLoS One. 2015 Jun 19;10(6):e0130158.) Preliminary research findings show that, the new grading criteria is an independent predictor of MI patients' poor prognoses. He believes that in the future, with the popularization of the new grading criteria, every AMI patient is expected to have their own grading early-warning signs after discharged from hospital. The early-warning sign is just like meteorological early-warning, it can keep patients aware of their health status, moreover, help different medical institutions and physicians to communicate patients' condition, promote better registration and management of patients with coronary heart disease and provide scientific and accurate index for working ability assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creating team of &lt;em&gt;My Psalm&lt;/em&gt; is a very young one, with three SJTU alumni as the core members. The Director Wu Feiyue and Superintendent Bai Yandong are the first batch of graduates from &lt;a href="http://smd.sjtu.edu.cn/english.php"&gt;SJTU School of Media and Design&lt;/a&gt;. The producer Cai Qingzeng was graduated from &lt;a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/"&gt;SJTU School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. The film focuses on six most ordinary workers, recounting their happiness and sadness in their daily work and life. In &lt;em&gt;My Psalm&lt;/em&gt;, the Chinese workers who have always been neglected by the public became the protagonist this time, and are respected by the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the good news of &lt;em&gt;My Psalm&lt;/em&gt; came, Chairperson of the University Council &lt;a href="/about-sjtu/administration/jiang-sixian"&gt;Jiang TransSixian&lt;/a&gt; and President &lt;a href="/about-sjtu/administration/zhang-jie"&gt;Zhang Jie&lt;/a&gt; congratulated the three. The Dean of Department of Film and Television Li Yizhong recollected that "the class where Wu Feiyue was in was very active. After graduation, Wu Yuefei worked very hard and realized his dream of Movie. His work is more about humane care and responsibility then skills, and thus has rich implications to the current students."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study provided a new idea to addressing the key issues in the field of phospholipid research. These new intelligent materials can also be used in bio-medicine, bio-imaging and other fields. Related content has applied for Chinese patents.

&lt;p&gt;This research disclosed evolution model that might exist for higher animal and angiosperm: numerous andro gametes produced by male gential organ had higher heritable variation level. The competition occurred in generative propagation is used to screen more adaptive heritable variation form (including new gene) so &amp;nbsp;that it could provide motive power for improving species' environmental suitability and the defensive power against pathogene. This research would help to explain the evolutionary implications of generative propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

Water pollution badly impacts the life of residents near the bank and downstream, and one of the most damaging factors is heavy material. But how can it be removed? The first thing to do should be to control the source. But enterprises are not willing to do so because of the high cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="quantum dot absorbent" src="/assets/4630/1yfjoz23jy_normal.jpg" alt="quantum dot absorbent" width="640" height="427" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, materials which can absorb heavy metal are acticarbon, polymergel, exchange resin and so on, yet the effects are all ordinary. How to find a highly effective and low-cost absorbent? Research fellow Li Liang and his team from &lt;a href="http://sese.sjtu.edu.cn/en/index.php"&gt;SJTU School of Environmental Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt; found a new quantum dot absorbent, which can effectively solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop new field of sewage treating with the help of "quantum dot"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Li Liang find that the "quantum dot" can be used to solve the problem of water pollution? Before he came back to China, Li Liang had always been doing research of the application of quantum dot. After entering SJTU to work, he combined his research direction and the status quo of the current water pollution problem, and developed the non-toxic absorbent with his team. However, the difficulty of separation posts another problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emerging of magnetic "quantum dot absorbent" solves the difficulty of separation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team of Li Liang finally found a suitable carrier. The "advanced" magnetic quantum dot absorbent could separate and recycle effectively in the premise of maintaining the original absorbing amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the absorbent very expensive then? Although the price of quantum dot absorbent is higher than ordinary absorbents, but the absorbing amount is dozens of times than ordinary absorbents and thus the using amount is much less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the research has applied for five patents, and Li Liang's team also cooperated with corporates to expand the production capacity. In the current conditions, they can make absorbent which could absorb 5 kilograms per hour. In the near future, it is possible that the absorbent could be mass produced.&lt;/p&gt;

A few days ago, this dream was realized by Laboratory for Bio Robotics and Biological Robots in Robotics Institute, School of mechanical and power engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Under the guidance of Zhang Dingguo, postgraduate student Li Guangye controlled a living cockroach with human mind, which has won the second prize in 2015 IEEE RAS students' video contest and would be exhibited in the top-level meeting ICRA2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Brain Control Cockroach" src="/assets/4627/1_normal.jpg" alt="Brain Control Cockroach" width="640" height="430" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research establishes the functional "brain-brain interface" between human and cockroach, sending signal of human mind to the brain of cockroach and realizing the remote wireless control of cockroach's action. Controller wears a portable wireless brain wave collecting device and their mind will have a directional intention based on the visual feedback and the visual stimulation; the computer will decode the brain wave received and recognize the directional intention of the controller, then transfer it into controlling signal and send it to the electronic backpack receiver on the back of the cockroach; microelectrode has been planted into the antennae nerve in the head of the cockroach, which produces a controllable living "machine animal". By virtue of the Bluetooth communication technology, controller could form a wireless communication between the computer and the electronic backpack which will receive the commanding signal from the controller's mind and send specific electric pulse to the antennal nerve of the cockroach through intrusive electrical nerve stimulation technique so to realize the controlling of cockroach by human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Brain Control Cockroach" src="/assets/4628/2_normal.jpg" alt="Brain Control Cockroach" width="640" height="482" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research realized the controlling of living cockroach to walk in S-shaped path and Z-shaped path by human mind. They pointed out that this research extended the traditional brain-computer interface technology and tentatively attempted the avatar brain-brain communication. In the future, this could also be used for complex terrain reconnaissance, risk-elimination and so on, and also lay a solid foundation for the uprising of brainwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reported that the researcher will still upgrade the controlling mode to realize the controlling of several cockroaches by several controllers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, 16 Chevrolet EN-V 2.0 electric concept cars are already in operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save energy, protect the environment and choose a low carbon way of commuting is a significant link in the basic state policy concerning the safety of energy and reducing waste emission. In these aspects, the promotion of new energy cars is of vital importance. Besides, electrification, intellectualization, and informatization are strategic directions of the global development of cars, in which unmanned driving and the telematics are important directions. In order to promote the development of advanced technology and act in accordance of the government's call-up, SJTU launched the building up of green campus network in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to promote the implement of relevant works, SJTU built up the new energy car data center, which currently has already the functions of collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and data mining abilities, and could provide service to the society. These have made a good foundation for the development of new energy car technology, the promotion, and the study of commercial mode. Apart from these, SJTU has also set 128 stakes on the campus of Minhang, Xuhui, and Fahua, and the personal new energy car has exceeded 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a famous mobile company in the world, GM has been devoted in the study of electrification, intellectualization, and unmanned driving of small electric car. The ideas of development of GM and SJTU coincide with each other, and this is the first step of the two sides' cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="GM China" src="/assets/4625/1_normal.png" alt="GM China" width="640" height="427" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court-accepted evidence in the Tokyo Trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;The publication of the book, a full record and review of war crimes committed by Japanese militarists in China and other countries in East Asia during World War II, is of historical value and meant to highlight the importance to cherish and maintain world peace and order, according to the Chinese editors' foreword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Trials were held from May 1946 to November 1948 in order to punish Japanese war criminals and restore international order in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The tribunal heard the testimony from 419 witnesses and admitted 4,336 exhibits," said Xiang Longwan, honorary director of the &lt;a href="http://tokyotrial.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx"&gt;Tokyo Trials research center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibits included depositions, documents, diaries, letters and reports, said the scholar, whose father Xiang Zhejun was among the Tokyo Trials prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregating and organizing all of them into a book took labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I actually got my first glimpse of this publication when I was wondering through the exhibit halls yesterday. My eye always goes to big publications, because I know just what it takes to bring out just a work," said &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/page.aspx?p=7"&gt;Karen Christensen&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/"&gt;Berkshire Publishing Group&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. partner of &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/page.aspx?p=7"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This big publication is a co-work between Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press and the publishing house of the &lt;a href="http://www.nlc.gov.cn/newen/"&gt;National Library of China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its world premiere at the &lt;a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/"&gt;Book Expo America&lt;/a&gt; (BEA) 2015 represented joint efforts by academic and publishing circles of both China and the United States to safeguard postwar order, said Wu Shangzhi, deputy director of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, of China.&lt;/p&gt;

Related research findings have been published on &lt;a href="http://www.aiche.org/publications/journals/aiche-journal"&gt;AIChE Journal&lt;/a&gt; (AIChE Journal&#65292;2015&#65292;doi:10.1002/aic.14760) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the researches into fuel cells, carbon dioxide capture, design theory&amp;nbsp; for multi-target and uncertainty of storage system (Fuel Cells, 2013,13(3)&#65306;321-335&#65307;Industrial &amp;amp; Engineering Chemistry Research, 2014, 53, 778-785&#65307;Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 2014, 135, 37-47), and facing BMS related problems like how to make lithium-ion battery operate with safety and endurance, He Yijun, Ma Zifeng and other researchers combined the design of complex chemical processes with characteristics of multi-target and uncertainty with Operational optimization theory and applied them in the research into the design theory of BMS, and managed to established a lithium-ion battery equivalent circuit model. Besides, they developed in&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"&gt; MATLAB&lt;/a&gt; software a single lithium-ion battery Simscape simulation platform, which helped implement model parameter identification and dynamic simulation. Additionally, they first proposed a polynomial open-circuit voltage mode based on nonlinear semi-infinite programming, which was an overt integration of Monotonic priori knowledge of OCV and SOC with the modelling process. Last but not least, they presented a global optimization method that could ensure OCV model in question satisfy monotone relationship and help to improve the accuracy and stability of the prediction made through SOC (Industry &amp;amp; Engineering Chemistry Research,2015, 54 (12):3167-3174).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modelling idea embodies&amp;nbsp;in this research is a universal method in that this model, as a pure data-driven modeling approach, it could help to surmount defects like difficulty in parameter calibration, large-scale complex calculation and real-time application going hand in hand with the current models.&lt;/p&gt;

THIEF team from SJTU stood out from a number of teams and won the grand prize of "game development" item in Chinese region and would soon attend the World competition on behalf Chinese region. Recently, the team is actively preparing for the game, striving to march into the world final that would be held in Seattle, USA this July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIEF team was guided by Professor Xiao Shuangjiu from SJTU School of Software, headed by graduate student of School of Software Chen Xu, and comprised of members from School of Media and Design (undergraduate students Wei Zihan, Wang Riyue and Huang Jin. The team was formed in September 2014 and has won great support from the university ever since. The team has cooperated and worked very well and forged theirway through preliminaries and semi-finals to the finals, standing out from more than 1,000 teams in China. In the finals held in Beijing, the team won the unanimous endorsement of the judges by their excellent product demonstrations and the wonderful reply to the Panel. Competing with strong teams like Adoor from Peking University and PuzzleWave from South China Agricultural University, THIEF from SJTU finally won the fierce competition and obtained the grand prize of "Microsoft Imagine Cup" in the Chinese region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What THIEF developed is a 3D puzzle game using two engines: Unity and Cocos. The experts said that this game is very mature in the overall planning, technology utilization, music and art production, players experience and other aspects. It is reported that a month before the Chinese regional final, the game had already been uploaded on two foreign professional gaming sites and was downloaded by a large number of players. The game also won the "Best Application of the Week". Lou Chi, the judge and chief editor of &lt;em&gt;Tencent Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt; said that he saw more and more Chinese young people starting thinking about innovation and entrepreneurship, and their courage to practice and pioneer. He also think that Microsoft "Imagine Cup" competition has not only inspired the &amp;nbsp;young Students' enthusiasm for innovation, but also provided professional guidance and advice for them, helping them to find a good linkage between their hobby and market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft "Imagine Cup" Global Student Competition is the world's largest and most influential student science and technology competition. Founded in 2003, it is aimed to encourage young students imagination and creativity, encouraging them to join in the technological innovation. Globally, over 160,000 students from more than 190 countries and territories participated in the competition. This competition has also won UNESCO's support. The participating students can unleash their creativity and technical skills on this platform and create a first-class technology solutions in the latest technology platform. Their idea would be transformed into commercial reality and in this way students' innovative spirit and social responsibility would be cultivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4591/24xfph9ctu_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="400" height="558" /&gt;In the morning of April 28, 2015, Xu Guangxian, academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, winner of State Highest Science and Technology Prize in 2008, Father of China Rare Earth, the class of 1944 alumnus of &lt;a href="/"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt; (SJTU), winner of SJTU Lifetime Achievement Award for Outstanding Alumni, passed away. During his lifetime, Xu Guangxian was concerned about the development of SJTU and SJTUers. He thanked SJTU for providing solid foundation for his life and his career. In SJTU, we also have a Gunagxian Road to show our deep friendship to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu Guangxian's family was middle class. His father opened a cloth store with others, thus his family was well-off. But after his second elder brother lost 8000 yinyuan (yinyuan is an ancient currency unit) in a gambling, his family became poor. Yet his mother told them, "you need to study hard and learn an expertise. Stop relying on our family." after that, Xu Guangxian kept his mother's words in his mind and started learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He graduated from the primary school with distinction. To find a job as early as possible, he just read a year in the high school and then transferred to the construction department of Zhejiang University, attached Hangzhou Advanced Industrial Vocational School with a second position. He recalled, "a year later, after Hangzhou fell into enemy hands, I went to Ningbo advanced industrial school together with the school and graduated in 1939. At that time, Xukun Railway Construction Engineering Bureau came to Ningbo to recruit intern engineers. 8 of our classmates were recruited. Then we were taken to Shanghai and lived in an inn. The employer told us that he would buy tickets for us, but he never came back. He run away with all our money. We were all dumb-struck. Then we drifted apart."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this incident, Xu Guangxian came to Shanghai alone and came to find his elder brother who was teaching in middle school. He then was introduced to be a teacher. At that time, SJTU was very famous in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. He admired SJTU so much that he decided to get involved in SJTU. After several months hard-work, he completed all the exercises in Big Algebra written by Hall and Knight and Analytic geometry written by Smith and Gale. In 1940, Xu Guangxian was admitted into the department of chemistry of SJTU with excellent academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gao Xiaoxia was classmate of Xu Guangxian in SJTU and they got married for common interests. In 1946, they passed the national students abroad examination. With relatives financial support, Xu Guangxian went to America beforehand in 1948 and studied in the department of chemistry of University of Washington. The same year, Xu Guangxian ranked the first in the summer academic probation class of &lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and was admitted as a graduate student majoring in quantum chemistry. At the same time, he was hired as a teaching assistant, salary received from which enabled Gao Xiaoxia to come to &lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; and majored in analytical chemistry. In 1949, Xu Guangxian received Master of Science degree from Columbia University; in 1951, his doctoral dissertation "Optically Active Quantum Chemical Theory" won him the doctorate degree in physical chemistry, making him the one who received his doctorate degree within the shortest time and was selected as a member of American Sigma Xi Honor Science Club. At the same time, Gao Xiaoxia was also granted the master's degree in analytical chemistry of New York University and went for further study. At that time, Columbia University wanted to engage Xu Guangxian as a lecturer or recommend him to be a postdoctor in the University of Chicago and ask him to join in American nationality. But they learned about the earthshaking changes in new China and the explosion of war to resist US aggression and aid Korea. After discussion, the couple determined to come back to China and devote themselves into the educational business of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till today, "cascade extraction" is still the theoretical basis of our rare earth industry. The Chinese storm caused by Xu Guangxian brought China hundreds of millions profits. This project won the third prize of national natural science, the National Science Conference award and the award of progress of science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, European countries and United States have been using percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) in clinical practice. The application of Interventional treatment is not only an effective way to terminate a large number of pulmonary regurgitation and improve blood circulation of lung tissue and the function of right ventricular, but also avoids a second time open-chest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After valved stent fully releases, pulmonary angiography shows that reflux disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thoracic surgery department and cardiology department of Shanghai Children's Medical Center has been cooperated since 2011. After a long-term experimental study, the research team led by Professor Liu Jinfen participated in the international cooperation projects of Venus-P pulmonary valved stent clinical trials. In this case, the child who accepted PPVI treatment in the hospital is 15 years old. The child was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot at birth and started to receive surgical treatment since sixth month. In the follow-up diagnoses over the past few years, it is found that the child started to have more severe pulmonary regurgitation, right ventricular progressive expansion and decreased capacity for action. Before the admission to hospital this time, the cardiac MRI examination revealed that the child's RV EDV Index has been up to 195ml / m&amp;sup2;, and the child's life was at stake. After carefully discussion, the medical team decided to apply PPVI treatment. With the assistance from department of heart surgery, echocardiographic, anesthesiology and nursing, Dr. Gao Wei and Dr. Liu Tingliang from Cardiology Department succeeded in applying the PPVI treatment and implanting a Venus-P valved stent. The cardiovascular angiography and echocardiography afterwards revealed that pulmonary regurgitation disappeared and the blood flowed smoothly, which indicated a satisfying result. The surgery lasted for one and a half hour and the first case proved to be a complete success. And the child has recently been healthy enough to leave the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long would a lollipop licking take? The team that Huang Jinzi is in, a graduate of Zhiyuan College, SJTU, and now a doctoral student in the Department of mathematics in &lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; found the answer in a study of solid solubility experiments. They put the lollipop in the pipeline, so that the water of different speed can flow through the pipe, then they used time-lapse camera to get its photos of dissolution process. They found that, no matter what the original shape the lollipop is and no matter how high flow velocity is, the final shape of lollipop is almost always the same when it's on the verge of dissolution. The study found the solubility of solid. Take the lollipop which is about one centimeter in diameter for example, it takes about 1000 times to lick. His study raises people's enthusiasm to be involved in scientific experiments. Huang Jinzi also won the 2015 pineapple Science Prize for mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

Post-doctor Zhou Shumin and doctoral student Cheng Li are both first authors of the thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast Cancer ranks first with regard to both morbidity and mortality for women on the planet. Triple negative breast cancer, TNBC sufferers make up for 15% to 20% of all Breast cancer patients. For a lack of surface hormone receptors and marker for detection, TNBC is not sensitive to the currently used hormone therapy or the targeted therapy, and the prognosis is poor. One of the main reasons lies in the fact that it is apt to migrate. In this sense, the discovery of the related marker for the migration of TNBC is of great significance to further research into the pathogenesis, clinical test and treatment of this cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the level of glycosylation and the differences on cell surfaces, which provides a new perspective for detecting biomarkers of other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was funded by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/863_Program"&gt;863 Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_973"&gt;973 Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Natural_Science_Foundation_of_China"&gt;National Natural Science Foundation of China.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed that students in blue caps and gowns are found everywhere on campus? Have you ever looked forward to the day when you are wearing those cool caps and gowns yourself ? On March 21, 2015, &lt;a href="/"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt; held its Graduate Commencement Ceremony for this year's postgraduates and PhDs. Before the ceremony began, all those blue gowns were already waiting in the New Stadium on SJTU Minhang Campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4526/%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="600" height="235" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls put on funny or adorable expressions and snapped group photos with the help of selfie-stick, while boys crowded together to chat. It was the last chance for them. Moreover, many graduate couples are catching our attention with their unique and public display of love. Loads of single "leftovers" were looking at them with envy. Graduates were happily taking photos with two pretty lamb dolls, this year's mascot. Those dolls were also in the same blue gowns and caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4527/%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A2_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="640" height="426" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony was grandly unveiled after the warm-up dancing and singing. &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/XUJL/Desktop/%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%94%9F/%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD/%E7%85%A7%E7%89%87/Downloads/Zhang%20Jie"&gt;Zhang Jie&lt;/a&gt;, President of SJTU, led the familiar school leaders and walked onto the rostrum. The whole stadium burst into a warm applause. "Bro Jie" placed high hopes and great expectations of innovation on graduates in his commencement speech. &lt;a href="http://www.caltech.edu/content/about-president-rosenbaum"&gt;Dr. Thomas Rosenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href="http://www.caltech.edu/"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; also attended the ceremony and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to mention that when granting degrees to graduates, given the fact that there were too many graduates in the stadium, Bro Jie could only let graduates DIY by saying "please shift the tassel on your cap from right to left" to save time. Accompanied by the well-meaning laughter, graduates stood up in turns and solemnly placed their tassels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SJTU has bid farewell to a number of excellent graduates, and sent those passionate and talented youngsters to the places where their dream started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the commencement ceremony, the news conference held together with Thomas Rosenbaum, President of California Institute attracted many media. Presidents of the two great universities shared their opinions on innovation. Bro Jie pointed out that, as one of the top Chinese universities, Shanghai Jiao Tong University attached great importance to the further cooperation with Caltech on innovative areas raised by NPC and CPPCC. President Thomas Rosenbaum said that the two universities would join hands in various research areas and reform the approaches to cooperation. He admitted that Chinese students were very excellent in advancing science and engineering. He believed that the two universities could draw on each other's merits for common progress, finally brought scientific research the world over to an unprecedented level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening of March 16th, Irish melody surrounded Jingjing hall of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Three musicians from&lt;a href="http://www.irishchamberorchestra.com/"&gt; Irish Chamber Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; brought a wonderful Feast of music for SJTU teachers and students. Austin Gormley, General Consul of &lt;a href="http://www.irishconsulateshanghai.cn/"&gt;Irish Consulate in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, Eoghan Patrick Duffy, deputy general consul of Irish Consulate in Shanghai and Hu Hao, Minister of Propaganda Department of SJTU Party Committee attended the concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, Austin Gormley said hello to SJTU teachers and students in fluent Chinese, which aroused the applause. He said "I am glad to come to this well-known university. Since tomorrow is Ireland's national day, I am glad to share with you our national music." Besides he hoped that teachers and students of SJTU could enjoy the Irish wonderful music and feel the unique artistic charm of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past six years, Irish Chamber Orchestra gave performance every year in Shanghai, but this is the first time they came to the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The orchestra hoped that the concert would show the charm of traditional Irish music to Chinese college students, so as to attract more Chinese young people to visit Ireland and study music. "We are looking forward to cooperate with SJTU Symphony Orchestra, and also hope to learn from outstanding Chinese musicians as an exchange and harvest in the cultural collision."&lt;/p&gt;

However, when building high-rise buildings, bridges and some other constructions, if the moisture content is too high, the soil will form saturated soft soil. When interact with other factors like earthquake wave and traffic load, the pile foundation is very likely to become loose. Currently this difficult problem was solved by Professor Wang Jianhua of &lt;a href="http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/"&gt;SJTU School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Through fifteen years, he led his team members to reveal the law of vibration mechanics in saturated soil, and the water in saturated soil, which is very destructive, is now likely to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Propagation Law" src="/assets/4518/2d7ycyxi6t_normal.jpg" alt="Propagation Law" width="640" height="480" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piling in dry hard soil to build bridges and high-speed rail is conducive to the stability of buildings. However, the soft soil has many pores with water in them, which would decrease the stability of piling. Plus the earthquake wave and other vibrations made by traffic, this raise very high requirement of the designing and implementing of the work. Wang Jianhua introduced that Shanghai is a typical area with soft soil, which brings huge challenges to the construction of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water in the soil has huge power. As the development of the modern city, railway, bridges and high buildings are built rapidly. The living space underground is also broadened. Therefore, safe and comfortable living and commuting space becomes the topic which draws more and more attention of people. Then how does vibration spread in the saturated soil with water? How to control the vibration and make the piling stable? For many years, this has been the difficult problems which are recognized in the whole world. After fifteen years' research, the team led by Wang Jianhua finally found the law of propagation of vibration mechanics and the influence of this kind of propagation to the stability of piling. According to these, the team built a series of calculating models, which provide theoretical method for the implementing of piling in soft soil areas. As the pioneering research at home, this research finding won the first prize of 2014 Natural Science Award of the Ministry of Education, and was accepted in the Shanghai &lt;em&gt;Standard of Foundation Design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team member of the research team mentioned that before people had any deep understanding of the law of propagation of vibration in saturated soil, they sometimes would assure the stability of buildings by adding piles, which could cause the waste of resources. If people could design the location and scale of piling according to the laws revealed by the team, they could save a respectable amount of expenditure. Currently, this finding has been used in Hongqiao Integrated Transportation Hub, Shanghai West Railway Station, and Shanghai International Finance Center, which saved more than 100 million RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with riverside and coastal areas, the ocean environment is even more complex. In the past several years, marine economy has become the important part of our domestic economy. With the exploitation of marine resources from shallow water to deep sea, from near sea to international sea area, if the ports, ocean platforms and under-sea pipes could withstand the vibration of ocean currents and seaquakes has become the indispensable factor of the development of marine resources and the safeguard of resources and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The soil in the bottom of the sea is saturated with water, and seaquakes and earthquakes in the bottom of sea occur very often. So compared with the land, the ocean environment is more complex. Piles and pipes in the sea should overcome many challenges like the saturated soil and wave earthquakes, and in this situation, the stability of ocean engineering is the top questions that we need to consider when exploiting marine resources." Wang Jianhua said that in addition to the construction on the land, this research finding also can be applied to the marine projects. In the meantime, the team has already begun the research of ocean foundation, and won one key project of National Natural Science Fund, and three supporting projects of National Natural Science Fund. It is believed that before long, the ocean engineering would be more stable and become the supporting point of development of marine economy and marine resources' utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

This year, OM China final was a grand scale, including 520 teams coming from 14 provinces, autonomous regions, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shandong etc., and Germany. 38 teams were college students, the scale of which was the largest in history. These college students came from 17 universities, like Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Tongji University and Shanghai University of Science and Technology. 5 undergraduate students representing SJTU attended the tournament and won the second prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long-term part, 5 SJTU students plotted a story based on the contest problem "experiencing technical difficulties" to show people's experiences in handling various technical problems in the future and to show concerns about the technical traps that we might encounter in the future. As to the techniques, 5 students took fully advantages of their majors by employing a series of ordinary materials, such as slide rail, CDs, photoresistance, KT board and rubber band etc., to make props, like scaffold whose lift control could be operated manually. In the off-the-cuff question part, students designed solutions to save the princess. They came up with lots of wonderful and amazing solutions, for example, they made Ma Liang with the magic paint brush to draw a road to the heaven; they enabled the sea to rise to the height leveling to the castle windowsill; they made the princess lie so that her nose could be long enough to be used as a brace. In the contest, 5 SJTU students fully employed their professional expertise, answered the questions creatively with good teamwork, and were highly praise by the judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the authoritative international journal of metabolic engineering - Metabolic Engineering has just published a latest research paper entitled "Engineering validamycin production by tandem deletion of &amp;gamma;-butyrolactone receptor genes in &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces hygroscopicus &lt;/em&gt;5008" done by the doctoral student Tan Gaoyi of School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology under the co-guidance of Zhong Jianjiang and Bai Linquan (Gao-Yi Tan, Yao Peng, Chenyang Lu, Linquan Bai*, Jian-Jiang Zhong* (2015). Engineering validamycin production by tandem deletion of &amp;gamma;-butyrolactone receptor genes in &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces hygroscopicus &lt;/em&gt;5008. Metabolic Engineering 28: 74-81. DOI: 10.1016/j.ymben.2014.12.003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4513/1_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="600" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validamycin is a kind of agricultural antibiotic produced by &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces hygroscopicus&lt;/em&gt; var. &lt;em&gt;jinggangensis&lt;/em&gt;. It is efficient and nontoxic, environmental friendly with low fungi resistance, which makes it one of the most important biopesticides in preventing and controlling rice sheath blight diseases. Currently, the annual output of validamycin is between 5 to 7 million tons in China, with wide application scope and large market potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Zhong Jianjiang has cooperated closely with Professor Deng Zixin's group ever since 2006. They have revealed the regulatory mechanism of &amp;gamma;-butyrolactone (GBL) in validamycin biosynthesis, and interpreted how exogenous 1,4-butyrolactone stimulates A-factor-like cascade for the first time. The work provided a new possibility for achieving a high antibiotic yield by engineering the bacterium, and also showed a simple but effective fermentation strategy (Gao-Yi Tan, Linquan Bai*, Jian-Jiang Zhong* (2013). Exogenous 1,4-butyrolactone stimulates A-factor-like cascade and validamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008. Biotechnology and Bioengineering 110(11): 2984-93. DOI: 10.1002/bit.24965).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has found that among the known actinomycetes' whole genomes, about 1/3 of the streptomycete genomes including that of &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces hygroscopicus &lt;/em&gt;5008 have multiple sets of &lt;em&gt;afsA-arpA&lt;/em&gt; homologues in GBL regulatory system, with an obvious difference from its classic system. With in-depth study, this research team elucidated the regulatory mechanism of several sets of &lt;em&gt;afsA-arpA&lt;/em&gt; homologues in validamycin biosynthesis, and upgraded the metabolic engineering of validamycin on the basis of the discovery. For the industrial strain, the yield of validamycin is improved from 19 g/L to 24 g/L while the fermentation productivity is enhanced to 9.7 g/(L d) from 6.7 g/(L d), both of which are the highest as ever reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy proposed by the research enables to improve the yield of validamycin remarkably and can also guide the metabolic improvement of actinomycetes with several sets of GBL regulatory system. The work is expected to spur the microbial pharmaceutical industry upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan 24, the "Master Forum" organized by &lt;a href="http://www.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/en"&gt;Shanghai Advanced Institution of Finance&lt;/a&gt; (SAIF), China Academy of Financial Research (CAFR), and Chinese Society of Finance was held in the Wenzhi Hall of&lt;a href="/"&gt; Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt;. World-famous economist Paul Krugman, also professor of &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/XUJL/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$DIa0.898/%E8%AF%BA%E8%B4%9D%E5%B0%94%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6%E5%A5%96"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the 2008 Nobel Economics Prize, delivered a lecture titled "The New Pattern of World Economy and the Opportunities and Challenges of China".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="/assets/4460/paul_normal.jpg" alt="1" width="640" height="427" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krugman is one of the most famous economists and trade theorists currently in the world, and also a diligent columnist. He was delicately related to SJTU, since he gave a lecture in SJTU Wenzhi Hall as early as in 2009 on his first visit to China, and was invited to be the honorable professor of SJTU. This time was his first time to China Mainland after six years, and also the only lecture in China during his tour to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Before the lecture, Executive President of SAIF Professor Zhang Chun, Vice President of SAIF Professor Chen Hong, Vice President of SAIF Professor Qian Jun and so on welcomed Krugman on the third floor of SAIF and they had an intimate conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Krugman in the keynote speech pointed out that currently the global economy is in an extremely stagnant situation and its duration was not predicted by many people including him. "In 2008 out economy was trapped into a dilemma, and now six years have passed, we still have not solved this problem yet, and the world economy even goes into the second turn weakness." Krugman said that some people will ask that whether the Europe will have a long-term deflation as Japan. For him, the question should be, whether Europe could avoid deflation. The reason is that if Europe goes into deflation, it will be hard for Europe to get rid of deflation. As to the American economy, Krugman said that it took a long time for America to recover its economy, and now the economy is developing with a fast speed. Krugman also pointed out that China has a good record of economic increase, but in the future China should encourage the increase of sustainable consumption. Looking forward, Krugman said that even if the progress of global economy becomes slow, we still could retain an optimistic attitude for many reasons. Now the world has grasped the modern technology, and we could go on boost the development of economy with technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the keynote speech, Krugman had a deep talk with guests attended. Apart from that, he also answered the question raised by audience patiently. To express gratitude, Executive President of SAIF Professor Zhang Chun, on behalf of the academy gave a roll painting with the old Shanghai as its theme to Krugman for his coming and excellent speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Since its foundation, SAIF tries its best to provide the integral and international financial and administrative courses, as well as invites world famous experts and scholars home and abroad to give a forecast of world economy with professional perspectives, thus, to provide students, alumina and economy enthusiasts a high-end platform to learn and exchange.

American scientist Phillips put forward the conditions of wave resonance in 1960. In 1962, Professor Benney of &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; found that amplitudes reveal themselves in periods, and the waves change periodically according to time. For half a century, scientists from the field of hydrodynamics are trying hard to find "resonant waves in steady state" which do not change with time, but they all failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href="/"&gt;SJTU&lt;/a&gt; research team of Liao Shijun applied the Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) to first acquire theoretically the resonant waves in steady state in unlimited and valid depth of water. And published two relative articles in the top journal named &lt;a href="http://www.efluids.com/efluids/pages/j_midpages/journal_of_fluid_mechanics.htm"&gt;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; (JFM), which first proved the existence of resonant waves in steady state. Besides, in 2014 the team of Liao Shijun used the world fisrt-class storm water pool in "national key laboratory of marine engineering" on Minghang Campus to fisrt proved the existence of resonant waves in steady state by experiments. The relative findings were published in Journal of Fluid Mechanics (JFM) recently. The theory and experiments enriched the theory of resonant wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reported that Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) is a mathematical method to resolve strong nonlinear questions and was put forward by Liao Shijun in 1992. The findings of resonant waves in steady state again proved the originality and potential of Homotopy Analysis Method.&lt;/p&gt;

They have created a lot of "Firsts." Therefore, News Network launched a special column called "SJTU Wisdom", focusing on the light of wisdom shown by SJTUers as well as demonstrating their significant contributions on national development and social advancement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title=" Deep-sea Oil and Gas" src="/assets/4449/4_normal.jpg" alt=" Deep-sea Oil and Gas" width="640" height="426" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period of China's Twelfth Five Year Plan, China has spent huge sums of money to build the operational capability of "deep-sea fleet" and now this fleet has already taken shape. During this forming process, the "platform security monitoring system" independently developed by SJTU has been taking good care of the offshore oil and gas platforms like "Offshore Oil 981". This system is known as the "Diagnosis Expert" of deep-sea oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Prevention before Remedy"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2014, Lingshui 17-2-1 well test was under process at China's CNOOC Deepwater flagship operating equipment "Offshore Oil 981" deepwater drilling platform. This test turned out to be a success. We obtained abundant high-quality oil and gas flow. This well is the first large high-yielding self-explored gas field in China, bringing a big surprise to a country that is in &amp;nbsp;growing demand for energy resources like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all the oil companies around the world are throwing money at drills, &lt;a href="/research/centers-labs/state-key-laboratory-of-ocean-engineering/"&gt;Professor Yang Jianmin&lt;/a&gt; and his team from &lt;a href="http://oe.sjtu.edu.cn/eng.php"&gt;SJTU's State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering &lt;/a&gt;(SKLOE) has chosen a less fancy research subject "Protecting the Security of Platform". This choice stems from a different way of thinking - "It is better to prevent accidents from happening than remedy afterwards." The "Deep-sea Platform Security Monitoring System" developed by SKLOE is the very "preventive measure".&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SKLOE started the research project of "Semi-submersible Drilling Rig Site Monitoring" for "Offshore Oil 981" in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Three Magical Weapons"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this "Deep-sea Platform Security Monitoring System" excel compared to other technologies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First weapon is innovation integration. This system integrates big data, high-precision real-time monitoring, satellite communications, artificial intelligence, 3D simulation and other technologies, including: real-time measurement system platform motion, wind, waves, currents and other ocean dynamic environment monitoring, key structural load monitoring, remote data transmission systems, data processing and analysis systems, data viewing and scene reproducing system, safety assessment and diagnostic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second weapon is a lot of valuable first-hand information. The system has recorded reliable data of the real performance of offshore platforms in the rough sea, which can help check the platform design and reflect the reliability of various equipment, ensuring the safety of this platform while accumulating precious information and reference for the designing of platform of the next generation. It also provides real and scientific data and information for the future development of marine engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third weapon is that this system can automatically collect data for a very long time unattended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buoyancy Installation Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ten years of painstaking research, 'Deep-sea Platform Security Monitoring System'&amp;nbsp;has formed a complete system including theoretical research, experimental research and practical ship applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyancy installation is another successful application of this monitoring system. The so-called "buoyancy installation" is the clever use of the water buoyancy to smoothly transfer the pre-assembled platform blocks that weigh several tons to the catheter holder that also are several tons heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitoring system installed on the key parts of platform blocks can provide real-time data for the entire installation process, arming the commander with technical basis to make the right judgments and issue the right directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of Monitoring System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once shipwreck accident happened, sea rescue team should be fast and professional. Faced with the special circumstances of the South China Sea, it is important that we build our own core technology system, and this is exactly where SKLOE's mission lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, the R&amp;amp;D work for the "upgraded" version of monitoring system "Remote Expert Consultation System" came to be included on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote expert consultation system can send back the data measured on the ship to land base. The data will be preprocessed and analyzed automatically in the land base. The system then will screen and judge the preliminary analysis and issue different levels of alarm according to predefined alarm conditions, such as flashing lights, siren and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, an expert committee will be established where the research areas and seniority level of those experts will be classified. Under normal circumstances, the experts of this committee will receive a monitoring and analysis report from the platform every day. After receipt of the report, experts will make comments on the health condition of the platform based on their own experience and then send the comments back to the land base. After the receipt of the expert opinion, the personnel of land base will give a comprehensive expert advice based on the comments and feed back to the platform operator. Thus, the platform staff can receive the health condition report of the platform every day, and make adjustments to the platform's operating plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

"Seahorse", the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) with SJTU in charge of the technical part, topped the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROV Seahorse is one of the key scientific research project achievements of the national 863 Program. Up to now, it is the very vehicle independently researched and developed by China with the largest system scale and the biggest dive depth. It passed the sea acceptance trial organized by 863 Program in 2014.
