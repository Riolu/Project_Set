<h1>Committee on Analytical Reagents&mdash;Purpose</h1>

<p> The American Chemical Society Committee on Analytical 

Reagents sets the specifications for most chemicals 

used in analytical testing. Currently, ACS is the only 

organization in the world that sets requirements and 

develops validated methods for determining the purity 

of reagent chemicals. These specifications have also 

become the de facto standards for chemicals used in 

many high-purity applications. Publications and organizations 

that set specifications or promulgate analytical testing 

methods—such as the United States Pharmacopeia and the 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—specify that ACS 

reagent-grade purity be used in their test procedures.</p>

<p> The ACS Committee on Analytical Reagents evolved 

from the Committee on the Purity of Chemical Reagents, 

which was established in 1903. Analysts at that time 

were disturbed by the quality of reagents available 

and by the discrepancies between labels and the actual 

purity of the materials. The Committee’s role in resolving 

these issues expanded rapidly after its 1921 publication 

of specifications for ammonium hydroxide and for hydrochloric, 

nitric, and sulfuric acids. Specifications appeared 

initially in<i> Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry</i> 

and later in its <i>Analytical Edition</i>. In 1941, 

the existing specifications were reprinted in a single 

pamphlet. Revisions and new specifications were later 

gathered into a book, the 1950 edition of <i>Reagent 

Chemicals</i>, and new editions appeared regularly thereafter. 

</p>

<p>The commonplace introduction of instrumentation into 

analytical laboratories, beginning in the late 1950s, 

resulted in dramatic improvements in the sensitivity 

and accuracy of analytical measurements. As a result, 

the specifications for reagent chemicals and the tests 

measuring their purity were improved so that the test 

methods would be as accurate and cost-effective as possible. 

The Eighth Edition, which became official in 1993, substantially 

changed and updated the general procedures and attempted 

to make the book easier to read. The Ninth Edition, 

which became official in 2000, continued the trend toward 

eliminating or simplifying some of the tedious classical 

procedures for trace analysis and adding instrumental 

methods where possible.</p>

<p> The objectives of the Committee on Analytical Reagents 

are

<blockquote>

1. To develop and have published standards (that is, 

specifications and methods of analysis) for reagents 

which have utility in analytical work; <br>

2. To revise, as appropriate, existing standards, and; 

<br>

3. To consider standards for additional useful reagents. 

</blockquote>

<p> <b>The Tenth Edition</b></p>

<p>Early in the planning stages for the Tenth Edition 

of <i>Reagent Chemicals</i>, Committee members voiced 

a desire for one book that met all of their needs for 

information on analytical reagents. They acknowledged 

that <i>Reagent Chemicals</i> is used in conjunction 

with other texts for information on the physical properties 

and the uses of analytical reagents. This resulted in 

a new direction for <i>Reagent Chemicals</i>, the inclusion 

of general physical properties and analytical uses for 

each reagent. The Tenth Edition continues the initiative 

to simplify the classical chemical methods and substitute 

instrumental analysis where appropriate. This edition 

introduces a new instrumental method, inductively coupled 

plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) for trace metal analysis. 

It also revises and updates procedures for polarography. 

Tests have been modified to take into account current 

laboratory practices and technology, as well as to eliminate 

the use of environmentally harmful chemicals.</p>

<p>Since the Ninth Edition, the Committee on Analytical 

Reagents has required validation protocols as part of 

the approval process for adding new reagents. In the 

Tenth Edition, 32 new reagents and three new classes 

of standard-grade reference materials are introduced, 

all of which have validation protocols. Other improvements 

in the Tenth Edition are intended to make the book easier 

to use. Some of these improvements include a CAS number 

index, a separate index for the standard-grade reference 

materials, complete assay calculations with titer values, 

an updated table of atomic weights, frequently used 

mathematical equations, a quick reference page on how 

to read a monograph, division of the book into parts, 

and a detailed table of contents for each part. Finally, 

a subtitle has been added to the Tenth Edition. This 

represents a slight shift in thinking and internal nomenclature. 

Traditionally, the Committee has referred to the individual 

entry for each reagent chemical as a specification, 

and each specification had two components: the requirements 

and the tests. However, these terms led to some confusion 

and, beginning with the Tenth Edition, the Committee 

has adopted the term <i>monograph</i> for the complete 

package of information for each reagent chemical—the 

general description, specifications, requirements, and 

tests. The <i>specification</i> refers to the purity 

requirements of the reagent, and the <i>requirement</i> 

is the level of purity required for the reagent to be 

considered “ACS Reagent Grade”.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the Committee on Analytical Reagents</b></p>

<p>As new information becomes available, the Committee 

updates the specifications and tests in this web site 

and occasionally adds new reagents or deletes obsolete 

ones. Updates are available to the reader on the Internet 

free of charge. The membership of the Committee was 

increased substantially during the preparation of the 

previous two editions in order to provide the specific 

expertise needed for the new sections, new techniques, 

and new reagents. Charles M. Wilson leads the subcommittee 

on new reagents, while William E. Schmidt steers the 

trace metals subcommittee and Michael A. Re directs 

the organics subcommittee. Michael Re also leads a new 

subcommittee on method validation, which is responsible 

for developing and maintaining the validation policy 

that takes effect in the Tenth Edition; this subcommittee 

also reviews and approves all validation protocols and 

post validation documentation.</p>

<p>The Committee urges that any errors observed be reported, 

invites constructive criticism, and welcomes suggestions, 

particularly for new reagents and improved test methods. 

Organizations wishing to adopt the ACS specifications 

for their own purposes are encouraged to do so by requesting 

permission. In this way, it is hoped that worldwide 

harmonization of reagent chemical specifications might 

occur. Communications on these subjects should be sent 

to the Secretary at this address. Anyone interested 

in serving on the Committee should also contact the 

Secretary.</p>
