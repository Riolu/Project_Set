            <h2>State Scientific and Technological Awards in 2011</h2>
<ul class="blue_arrow">
<li>Perfluoro-ionomer Exchange Materials and Their Applications<br /> A set of inventions with their application in various fields are involved in a series of per-fluorinated ion exchange materials. Tens of fluorinated compounds were synthesized mainly composed of fluorinated intermediates and perfluoro-monomers including perfluorosulfony1 viny1 ethers. Target polymers are perfluorosulfonic ion exchange resins and perfluorocarboxylic ion exchange resins which possess unique chain structures and end groups. Chloralkli cell membranes and fuel cell membranes with excellent properties are fabricated through the invented technology. All the materials have been industrialized and commercialized after extensive experiments and pilot trial runs. Lots of problems comprising mechanisms, technologies, engineering and equipments have also been successfully overcome one by one. The birth of China's perfluoro-ion exchange membrane, which is highly praised by Hu Jintao, is a milestone in the development history of Chinese chloralkli industry as well as in that of the whole chemistry industry. The inventions have far-reaching significance in Chinese special material fields.</li>
<li>Digital Design and Equipment Development for Complex Sheet-metal Product Assembly Process<br /> The project aims at meeting the demand of independent development of complex sheet-metal products in automobile, high-speed rail and aeroplane industries. The contributions include: 1) establish a digital assembly variation simulation method to replace physical prototype cars; 2) apply robust optimization in sheet-metal assembly process to improve the dimensional quality while reducing the cost; 3) develop a series of high-efficient and high-precision fixture equipment for sheet-metal flexible assembly. In the project, 9 patents and 4 software copyrights are authorized, and 77 papers are published in this spell. These achievements are applied in 3.91 million automobiles of Shanghai GM and SGMW as well as aircraft and high-speed railway industries, the manufacturing cost and development period were significantly reduced.</li>
<li>Key Technology and Equipments of Soil-crop Information Collection and Precision Fertilizer Application<br /> Agricultural production in China is highly dependent on excessive fertilizer investment, but the actual utilization rate is only 30%, the others filter into water, soil and agricultural products, which make 60% of soil and water pollution. The best way to solve the problem is to precise fertilization with VRT, but its core technology: crop and soil parameters online accurate measurement is the open problem, and map based fertigation control is the technical bottleneck. The project is supported by 863 plan and etc., the precise soil and crop information acquisition, the fertilization prescription generation and variable application are made the innovative achievements through 10 years. This project has 82 intellectual-properties. SCI/EI 92 papers are published in <em>SCIENCE CHINA</em>, <em>IEEE</em> etc. The yield monitoring system "measuring accuracy and stability better than foreign products", and the soil moisture sensor "part of the performance better than the international similar products". The research realized the industrialization and formed series products. 3.37 million acres is promoted by this project at tens provinces in three years, saving more than 14,000 tons of fertilizer. The popularization and application significantly reduced the soil and water pollution, promote the agricultural production safety and quality, and promote the sustainable development of modern agriculture in China.</li>
<li>Studies on Children's Sleep and Their Applications<br /> This project was focusing on children's sleep and related health outcome. A national wide multicenter epidemiological study has been conducted to explore the quality and quantity of sleep of 30250 children from birth to 18 years old. The results showed that the average children's weekday sleep duration in China was all far below the national recommendation, and than their peers in western countries. We further found that school schedule, particularly early school start time, contributed to sleep insufficiency and daytime sleepiness. In order to explore the effect of sleep insufficiency on children and adolescents and its mechanism, several clinical researches as well as animal studies have been done which showed that sleep loss is closely related with cognitive deficits, mood disturbance and weight gain. Given the widespread epidemic of sleep insufficiency in children, we persuaded the policy makers to pay close and immediate attention to this problem and proposed a sleep intervention plan to adjust school start time. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, we did a follow up study to evaluate it and found out that a 30-minute delay of school start time increased sleep duration by 23.4 minutes on average, and decreased the prevalence of daytime sleepiness by 9%.</li>
<li>The phenotype and non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis and its clinical intervention<br /> The clinical researches and basic series of the project lasted for 10 years. They explain the molecular mechanism of the phenotype expression of liver fibrosis from molecular, cellular and the overall system and explore several new targets for medical treatment. During the study, the researches screen and optimize clinical indicators and build the non-invasive diagnostic model of liver fibrosis for CHB, thus preventing 39.5% of the patients from receiving liver biopsy. The project also elaborates and confirms the value of nucleoside drugs and oxymatrine in improving histological fibrosis, preventing the disease from worsening and bettering the clinical outcome. The method is now applied in various medical institutions from all levels. The project provides new technology for dynamic monitoring of the clinical non-invasive diagnosis, resulting in positive social and economic effect.</li>
<li>Hugues de Th&eacute; was awarded the International Scientific and Technological Cooperation Award of the People's Republic of China<br /> In 2002, promoted by Professor Hugues de Th&eacute; and his Chinese collaborators, Sino-France Collaborative Center of Life Science and Genomics was set up and it has become the biggest platform for collaborations of the two countries in the field of life science. Based on the well running of the Center, International Association Laboratory "Post-translational Modifications in Cancer" (LIA) was established in 2006 which has attracted more French and Chinese scientists to join in. The establishment of the Center and LIA was highly valued and evaluated by French government.</li>
